# Face Clustering

# Description
This project implements face clustering to automatically group images containing similar faces. It employs various feature extraction and clustering models to evaluate their effectiveness in this task.

# Feature Extraction
- Multiple Feature Extraction Models: Explore the performance of different models, such as VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3, MobileNet, EfficientNet, FaceNet. You can use any feature extraction model you want, just by executing the cell with the marked model name in the code.

# Clustering Algorithm
- Clustering Model Comparison: Experiment with various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to determine the most suitable approach for your dataset. Name of each Clustering algorithm is marked in code.

 # Accuracy Evaluation
- Accuracy Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each combination of feature extraction and clustering models using adjusted Rand index to identify the most accurate configuration.
  

# Usage
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alirezasajjadi/Face-Clustering.git
```
- The hyper parameters are set for the uploaded dataset. You can tune it according to your dataset.
- You can change the dataset, just by change the path in 1-Load dataset section.
